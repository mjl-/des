# status

finished.  passes tests.


# intro

this is a DES library.  it is written in portable c, it does not
need to know if it runs on a little or big endian machine.  it is
easy to understand as it directly uses the tables from the DES
specification (only the sboxes have a different layout, generated
by the included sbox.py).  it is not optimized.  it does have tests,
which it passes.  the code is in the public domain for easy inclusion
in external software.


# install

this is just a library.  "make" will compile it (libdes.a).  "make
run" will run the test suite.


# latest version

get it from http://www.ueber.net/code/r/des


# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# caveats

des.h uses the types "uchar" and "uvlong".  if your system does not
define those, you can define them yourself (before inclusion of
des.h).  for example:

	typedef unsigned char uchar;
	typedef unsigned long long uvlong;
	#include "des.h"
